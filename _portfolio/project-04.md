People nowadays tend not to see things not because they are not visible but because everything is now hypervisible.

In this installation, the goal is for the person to explore the videogame, in a blackbox setting, and try to find out what to do next, with only visual and audio feedback and no explicit instructions.

The person has to be willing to experiment and play around with the game as to figure out what to do.

It is also meant to be played by a single person that has to be standing right in front of the box but everyone else can have its own radio hearing to the sounds of the game.

Even when everyone can hear what is going on, most of the times there is only one person making the effort to do something and help others...
