Gravemente (The Black King) is a piece of painting/sound art that has been submitted for a contest (and can't be fully displayed just yet).

The painting itself was made by using a canvas made by me using cardboard and gesso, that was placed on top of the speaker of a bass combo, that I would manipulate, along with the pedal effects, so that it would affect the paint/ink on the canvas.

The sound that was going through the amp was a series of electric bass improvisations I recorded with a Boss RC loop pedal, overdubbing/stacking some layers of improvisation, and having the sound go through a series of pedal effects.

While I was painting, I recorded with a portable sound recorder the whole process. Afterwards, I edited into 3 tracks the different parts of the process and released it in bandcamp.
