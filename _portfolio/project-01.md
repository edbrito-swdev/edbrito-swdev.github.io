This 360º VR Video was made as an output for the exploration of the ideas what is being post-human and how we are fragmented in today's society.

Each part of the sculpture shows different videos, each of them related to different parts of our current society and how the critical post-humanist philosophy/framework exposes and explores some of these concepts and ideas.
