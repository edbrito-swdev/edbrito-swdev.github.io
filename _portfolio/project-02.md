My cat had been lost for 28 days when I finished this video... I wanted to convey the feelings of sadness and loss and think about the rituals people use/do to help deal with the situation...

I used videos in the public domain related to this subject, along with recordings I had from my cat. I wanted for both the video and sound to pass the crushing feelings I was feeling at the time.
