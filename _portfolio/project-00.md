We (a group a 3 people) created visuals, that were used for 15 minutes of live performance with the ODE (Orquestra de Dispositivos Electr√≥nicos). 

ODE plays improvised electronic music and we had a MIDI device programmed so we could trigger the visuals in realtime, according to whatever the orchestra was doing at the time.

Each people of the group had a different concept that we worked together to blend together for our performance.
