In July 2024, before leaving for the World Kendo Championships, I left my last job as a Senior Software Developer.

After coming back from Italy, I started working on creating my own company. The process for that should be almost over (*knocks on wood*) and I'm now setting everything in place so people can find me and my company.

My hope is to collaborate with creative individuals who share a genuine desire to make the world a little better for everyone.

Nabia Studios' mantra is: *Experiences Enriching Lives*.

We intend on being an inclusive and supportive company that is able to reach our customers' hearts and minds through our own creative endeavours. At the same time, we also want to provide new tools and technologies that will empower others to explore their own self-expresion and creativity.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
